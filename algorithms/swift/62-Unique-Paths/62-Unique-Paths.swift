/*
 62. Unique Paths

 A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

 The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

 How many possible unique paths are there?

 Note: m and n will be at most 100.

 Example 1:

 Input: m = 3, n = 2
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 1. Right -> Right -> Down
 2. Right -> Down -> Right
 3. Down -> Right -> Right
 Example 2:

 Input: m = 7, n = 3
 Output: 28

        for i in 1..<m {
            for j in 1..<n {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
            }
        }

        return dp[m-1][n-1]
    }
}
